# Logic takes time to learn. 
There will be many many tasks needed for a general AI system but one of the key fundamental requirements will be how to be logical. Even logic can be thought of as a pipeline of organized rules to follow. We will likely need a specialized GPT for logical reasoning and a general agent keeping track of varying priorities. Logic is really a method of organizing a large set of preferences like (donâ€™t die and be happy, and while learning and advancing a goal. In game theory it equates to taking small steps that lead to a better outcome while not losing. In a computer architecture we can just spin up a new agent and call the agent again and again. This is sort of like starting a new life over and over again.  As long as the agent shares some advancement to a collective database then all future agents prosper. Success is not certain but reaching a absolute or local minimum (loss) is certain over a given time. 

# General task planner.
The inputs will be first and second order features of a given state. I will give an example. To go from one state to the other state requires a very precise definition of this space. The definition is a set of features that can be calculated. These features are a set of other slightly more fundamental features. Therefore we will also need a GPT that can divide a given feature into another set of features. This can be thought of in computer terms as a recursive function to be called again and so repetitively dividing the Feature space from a condensed set of features for a given State space. I consider Features similar to a  How do we identify the new set of features from one high level feature? We can find features across multiple models that are fixed and fundamental by training from multiple sources and landing on the same features? Can we use a different sensor and still get the same fundamental features like speed of gravity from video of an object falling or a baseball being thrown and use the parabola to calculate gravity then repeat this via a time of flight sensor or a phased array of sound detectors able to track an object and also calculate the rate of acceleration of gravity? Gravity would be the fundamental feature shared by objects on the same planetary body.  Once we get to a value that is not changing rapidly or perceptively then for the time being that will be the fixed value for a time until it does not seem to match like in space or in an airplane or any state that affects the observable rate of gravity.  We do not need to have the features targeted but rather untargeted and then discovered with empirical data then described via examples and text description of the inputs needed and the observation. In essence the key to the task planner is actually the Root Cause Analysis bot.

# Root Cause Analysis bot
This bot's goal will be to identify what are the effectors of a given action. When a state changes this bot will evalute all known effectors in the space and determine what are the primary effectors and to what degree. An object moved via an external force. What was the force?  Are there more than 1 cause of the action?
